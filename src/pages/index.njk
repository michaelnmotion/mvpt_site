By focusing on improving your posture and the mechanics of how you walk and run, we help you build a solid foundation for all your fitness goals. This method is for everyone, regardless of age or current fitness level. Together, we'll work to alleviate pain, improve your functional strength, and unlock your body's natural ability to move efficiently.</p>

<h2>Commmon Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-container">
<div class="faq-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="faq-question">
<span>How is this different from physical therapy?</span>
<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>While physical therapy focuses on injury rehabilitation, Functional Patterns addresses the root cause of movement dysfunction. We work on correcting your walking and running mechanics, which are fundamental to all human movement. This approach doesn't just treat symptoms – it prevents future injuries by teaching your body to move as it was designed to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="faq-question">
<span>Is this suitable for seniors?</span>
<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Yes! Functional Patterns is especially beneficial for seniors as it focuses on the movements you do every day – walking, standing, and maintaining balance. The system is scalable to any fitness level and helps maintain independence by improving strength, posture, and coordination. Many clients see improvements in their daily activities and reduced pain within weeks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="faq-question">
<span>Is Functional Patterns right for athletes?</span>
<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Absolutely! Many athletes develop compensatory movement patterns that can limit performance and increase injury risk. Functional Patterns helps athletes move more efficiently, reducing energy waste and enhancing performance. Whether you're a weekend warrior or professional athlete, optimizing your fundamental movement patterns will benefit your sport-specific skills.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="faq-question">
<span>Can Functional Patterns training help with chronic pain?</span>
<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Yes. Many of my clients come to me with back pain, joint discomfort, or recurring injuries. Instead of just masking the symptoms, we work on correcting the underlying movement patterns that cause strain in the first place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="faq-question">
<span>How long until I see results?</span>
<span class="faq-icon">+</span>
</button>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Many clients notice improvements in posture and movement awareness within the first few sessions. Significant changes in pain levels and movement quality typically occur within 4-8 weeks of consistent training. However, everyone progresses at their own pace depending on their starting point, consistency, and specific goals.</p>

<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<div class="testimonial-carousel-container">
<ul class="testimonial-slider">
<li>
<p class="testimonial-text">"I spent 6 months training with Michael and it greatly improved my posture and the way I move. Michael’s passion for FP was evident in each session as he always went above and beyond to ensure all the exercises were executed perfectly to optimise results and explain the mechanics and reasoning for performing each exercise. Would highly recommend Michael if you face any pains or want to become a better athlete."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">"I’ve been training with Michael for 3 months and I’m really happy with the progress. He’s professional, knowledgeable, and truly passionate about what he does. Always patient and respectful, he creates a comfortable space to train while staying focused on results. Highly recommend! "</p>

<div class="star-rating">★★★★★</div>

</li>
<li>
<p class="testimonial-text">"The first thing I noticed when training with Michael was that I had to adjust the rear-view mirror in the car because I was sitting so much more upright. I had a hunched posture for a really long time as well as a significant left/right hip imbalance from years of competitive cycling in a slightly skewed position. Michael made significant improvements to both my posture and my left/right mobility fairly soon after I started training with him. This has had flow on benefits to my awareness of my position on the bike and in other sports."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">"Oesteos and physiotherapists didn't really help my hip after a skiing accident that I really struggled to recover from 2 years ago. After 3 months of training with Mic just once a week I can put socks on without sitting down and my day-to-day movement is undeniably improving."</p>

<li>
<p class="testimonial-text">"Working with Michael has been a game-changer for my posture which I have always struggled with. Each session builds on the last, and I'm genuinely feeling better and better with noticeable improvements in my daily comfort and movement. I highly recommend Michael to anyone looking to make real, lasting, positive changes to their physical well-being"</p>
