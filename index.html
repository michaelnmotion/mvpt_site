                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>While physical therapy focuses on injury rehabilitation, Functional Patterns addresses the root cause of movement dysfunction. We work on correcting your walking and running mechanics, which are fundamental to all human movement. This approach doesn't just treat symptoms – it prevents future injuries by teaching your body to move as it was designed to.</p>

                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes! Functional Patterns is especially beneficial for seniors as it focuses on the movements you do every day – walking, standing, and maintaining balance. The system is scalable to any fitness level and helps maintain independence by improving strength, posture, and coordination. Many clients see improvements in their daily activities and reduced pain within weeks.</p>

                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Absolutely! Many athletes develop compensatory movement patterns that can limit performance and increase injury risk. Functional Patterns helps athletes move more efficiently, reducing energy waste and enhancing performance. Whether you're a weekend warrior or professional athlete, optimizing your fundamental movement patterns will benefit your sport-specific skills.</p>

                            <p>Yes. Many of my clients come to me with back pain, joint discomfort, or recurring injuries. Instead of just masking the symptoms, we work on correcting the underlying movement patterns that cause strain in the first place.</p>

                            <p>Many clients notice improvements in posture and movement awareness within the first few sessions. Significant changes in pain levels and movement quality typically occur within 4-8 weeks of consistent training. However, everyone progresses at their own pace depending on their starting point, consistency, and specific goals.</p>

I had a hunched posture for a really long time as well as a significant left/right hip imbalance from years of competitive cycling in a slightly skewed position. Michael made significant improvements to both my posture and my left/right mobility fairly soon after I started training with him. This has had flow on benefits to my awareness of my position on the bike and in other sports."</p>
