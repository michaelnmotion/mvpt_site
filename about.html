                <h2>About Me | My Journey & Functional Patterns</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Michael, and my journey into personal training and Functional Patterns (FP) isn't just a career path; it's a testament to overcoming profound personal struggle.</p>

                <p>I intimately understand the frustration and despair that come with chronic pain and movement limitations because I lived it. For two long years, chronic hip pain was my constant companion; I couldn't even perform a simple hip hinge without my body compensating in a dozen weird ways. I was even diagnosed with Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI).</p>

                <p>I went through the wringer, diligently working with physiotherapists, podiatrists, and chiropractors for months on end, following their advice to the letter. Despite my best efforts, lasting relief remained elusive.</p>

                <p>This was a jarring contrast to my life before the pain. I was an active triathlete, proud to have an Ironman under my belt, and enjoyed the challenge of Olympic weightlifting. As my hip pain worsened, bringing with it recurrent neck, back, and foot problems, it felt like my entire life had been upended. My vision for the future dimmed as the pain seemed to take over everything.</p>

                <p>Then, I found Functional Patterns. It was a revelation, fundamentally changing how I understood human movement and biomechanics. This approach wasn't just about addressing symptoms; it was about truly understanding the root cause. I am forever grateful to Fiachra Eviston from FP Melbourne for his invaluable help in my journey, and to Naudi Aguilar for his courage in going against the grain to bring higher quality training and first principles to the world through Functional Patterns.</p>

                <p>Having personally navigated the complexities of FAI and chronic hip pain, I find a particular fulfilment in working with individuals who share similar struggles. My empathy runs deep, but more importantly, my training delivers practical results by consistently stressing the correct muscles and tissues around the lumbopelvic region to foster regeneration. This isn't just theory; it's the precise application that helped me, and can help you.</p>

                <p>Now, my passion is to guide others through their own transformations. I'm committed to helping you break free from pain and move with greater freedom and efficiency, whether your goal is everyday comfort, peak athletic performance, or simply moving well for life. I continuously seek out and apply the most effective methods to ensure my clients achieve profound, sustainable results.</p>
