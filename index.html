                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    Functional Patterns is a training methodology that was founded in 2006 by CEO Naudi
                    Aguilar. Naudi has conducted seminars globally certifying practitioners. I
                    confidently say that Functional Patterns is the best in the fitness industry. Just look at the
                    results achieved worldwide by Functional Patterns practitioners.

                <h2>What are Functional Patterns?</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike any other point in human history, the main health crisis we face is the imbalance
                    within our society and our disconnection from nature. Moving away from natural practices
                    and shifting towards a more modern way of living has greatly affected our ability to move
                    correctly and stay out of pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how can we achieve balance in a world filled with imbalance? The answer is
                    straightforward: our health depends on how well we adapt to the natural environment. The
                    more harmoniously we coexist with nature, the healthier and more resilient we become. For
                    humans, this means bringing us back to the beneficial aspects of our evolutionary blueprint
                    that made us healthy to begin with.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="the-blueprint">
                <h2>The Blueprint</h2>
                <p>
                    There‚Äôs an evolutionary blueprint to how all organisms work and Functional Patterns has
                    been cracking the code in human movement for nearly 15 years. Resulting from tens
                    of thousands of hours in testing, I have pioneered the FP methodology, syncing the
                    physics of our natural environment to our health better than any other system out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My conclusion has been to train humans according to their biological movement
                    characteristics: Standing, Walking, Running, and Throwing ‚Äî The ‚ÄúFP Big 4‚Äù. By optimizing
                    these four human functions, achieving better health is not a gamble, but an inevitability.
                    This is what it means to train Functional Patterns!

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Michael! My journey into personal training and Functional Patterns started with my own struggles with chronic hip pain, movement limitations and surgery reccomendations. After two years trying numerous conventional approaches without success, I discovered FP and it completely changed my understanding of human movement and biomechanics.</p>
                <p>My passion is to help others break free from pain and move better, whether that's for daily life, sport, or longevity. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and applying the most effective methods to help my clients achieve real, sustainable results.</p>
